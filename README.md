# Sign Language Detection  

## Description  
This project uses **MATLAB** to train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for recognizing hand gestures representing letters Aâ€“Z. The model is trained on the **Sign MNIST dataset** and achieves high accuracy in classifying sign language letters.  

## Features  
- Trained a **CNN model** on the **Sign MNIST dataset** using MATLAB  
- Achieved **94% accuracy** in recognizing hand gestures  
- Tested with new images to validate model performance  

## Technologies Used  
- **MATLAB** (Deep Learning & Image Processing)  
- **Deep Learning Toolbox** (CNN Training)  

## Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ridanasser/Sign-Language-Detection.git

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd 'path/to/Sign-Language-Detection'

3. Run the training script:

   ```bash
   trainModel

4. Test the model with a new image:

   ```bash
   testModel('path/to/image.jpg')

## Usage
- Train the CNN model on the Sign MNIST dataset.
- Use the trained model to classify new sign language images.
- Modify training parameters in trainModel.m for experimentation.
